## Overview

With the recent passing of teacher appreciation week, the attention of several media streams have been focused on teachers in the United States and the impact they have in the lives of children. Although teachers play a large role in peopleâ€™s lives from kindergarten to higher education, the United States does not value the work that teachers do as much as some other countries. We wanted to take a look at how respect for teachers differs in different countries and to see if this evaluation is correlated with academic success of students. 

To explore this question, we used data from the 2018 Teacher Value Index, a measure of how greatly teachers are valued, to understand the variation in respect for teachers across countries. We then used PISA scores from math, reading, and science to see how the differences in teacher respect impact student achievement. We used scatterplots and bar graphs to analzye our data and produce data visualizations. 

Through our data analysis, we found there was a slight positive correlation between Teacher Value index scores and PISA scores in math, reading, and science across countries, with a few notable outliers. We also found a positive correlation between teacher salary and PISA scores. This indicates that increasing teacher respect and salaries may be a mechanism to improve student achievement.  

### Downloading the data

Our dataset can be accessed at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpGGobzVmC_6Wz8jchz4v5VqPRVy8A6jHVfBURx-VGg/edit#gid=0. This dataset contains the Teacher Value index scores, PISA scores in reading, math, and science, and average teacher salary across countries.  

### Running the code

To run the code, you must import pandas, numpy, and plotlyexpress. A link to the collaboratory notebook is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M_rXdIbCMPvoaRK9BLGiVCn4LVehbA1z#scrollTo=_7vh3-GpEIp9

## Contributing to the code

The next steps for this project would be to look at the correlation between teacher salary and student achievement between states in the United States, given that our American school system has such drastic variety across the states, to learn if there is a similar pattern as what we found here.
