### Overview
   The point of our analysis was to investigate opioid prescription, opioid usage, and opioid abuse in the United States. We started by analyzing characteristics of opioid prescribers (gender, state, credentials, specialty, etc.). Our main visualization of this information is organized in a pie chart. Many of our subsequent analyses were based on this initial data set.
   After looking at prescriber information, we looked at patterns by state. This included finding the average and total number of prescriptions by state. We represented these patterns using choropleth maps. Additionally, we created a heatmap of each medication by state to demonstrate the pattern of number of prescriptions by medication.
   To learn about opioid abuse, we created a choropleth map of opioid deaths in the United States. We also ran a regression between average number of prescriptions and the number of opioid deaths in each state. We ran a series of analyses to look at patterns among specific medications, creating a bar plot and identifying the medications that are prescribed the most frequently.
   Finally, we concluded our analyses by studying Narcan, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses.

### Dataset
We started with a dataset on opioid prescribers in different states. As we expanded the scope of our analyses, we brought in different datasets that included information about overdoses and Narcan.

### Running the Code
The code should be run by running the code from top to bottom.
    
### Contributing
One could expand these analyses by comparing the use and prescription of opioids in the US and other countries. Additionally, several of our choropleth maps could be integrated to make one interactive map.
