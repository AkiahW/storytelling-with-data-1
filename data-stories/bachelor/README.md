# Project Information
### Group Members
Amelia Ockert (apockert), Hannah Utter (hannahutter99), Isha Liu (ishaliu), Keara Dennehy (kearadennehy), and Nathan Hwang (nhwang1325)
### Contributions
Amelia, Keara, and Isha did the data wrangling and visualizations. Hannah and Nathan did the script and video.
# Overview
### Main Question
Our research question was "what factors are related to a couple's success on the Bachelor or Bachelorette?". 
### Approach
We analyzed factors such as age, reception of the first impression rose, social media followers, and being on the Bachelor vs the Bachelorette to gain an understanding of predictors of success for Bachelor Nation couples.
### Findings
We found that successful couples tend to have a smaller age gap than unsuccessful couples, people who receive the first impression rose are more likely to "win" the show, and couples on the Bachelorette are typically more successful than couples on the Bachelor. We did not have any significant findings related to social media followers.

# Data Downloading
We gathered our data manually by Googling each season's couple and compiled it into a Google sheets, found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zVQBxWgsfVtPLRcGKbU2ZSPvsr0BtVP1Z3HU7wr4-Eg/edit#gid=0. We then loaded it into our Colab notebooks from downloaded CSVs.

### Description
At the start of our code, we install and import all the libraries we need. Then, we import the data from a downloaded CSV and create Pandas data frames. After that, we make visualizations of social media interactions with the show and success related to age, first impression rose reception, social media followers, and Bachelor vs Bachelorette.

### Next Steps
Next steps for this project could be comparing couples' success in Bachelor Nation with other reality shows about finding love, such as Love Island. It would also be interesting to further explore the differences between male-led and female-led heterosexual relationships by analyzing couples on dating apps such as Tinder and Bumble. Finally, more detailed data about contestants gaining or losing Instagram followers on the Bachelor or Bachelorette could lead to more substantive findings about social media and these relationships.
### Questions
Do one-on-one or group dates help predict someone's success on the Bachelor or Bachelorette?
Does screen time help predict someone's success on the Bachelor or Bachelorette?
Does overall age (not age gap) relate to a Bachelor Nation couple's success?
### Challenges
A major challenge for this project was the manual data collection that we had to complete. For the social media data, we had to Google search every Bachelor and Bachelorette and their season's winner and then look for their Instagram account and record their followers. We were unable to look at change in followers before and after being on the show because the archival website we wanted to use didn't go back far enough. Additionally, we had the challenge of visualizing comparisons between the Bachelor and Bachelorette that would not be skewed by the fact that the Bachelor has more seasons.
### Known Bugs
The only known "bug" with our notebooks is that we started out with three notebooks (one for each Amelia, Isha, and Keara) then combined them into one notebook.
