# Overview

### Main Question

Our research question was: "How can making small changes in your diet make an impact on the environment?"

### Approach

We looked at how eating meat affects the environment by analyzing C02 emissions released by different sectors of the food industry, estimating individual emissions for certain types of diets, and looking how changes in diet can decrease individual emissions. We then contextualized these findings by presenting data on how others are making these changes in their diets, how different types of meat can be better or worse for individual emissions, and how exactly someone can make these changes in their life. 

### Findings

We found that the production of many animal-based food products (such as beef, seafood, and milk) result in the highest total emissions out of any other food sectors. Overall, when looking at individual and worldwide projected emissions, we found evidence that small changes in one's diet can result in a more sustainable personal impact.

### Description
The code is organized into 3 sections based on group member contributions. Before running the sections, import all needed CSV files. In each section, Pandas data frames were created from the imported CSV files. Visualizations were then made from the data using the Plotly and Plotnine libraries.
