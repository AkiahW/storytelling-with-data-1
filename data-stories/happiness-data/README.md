Overview
    The purpose of our analyses was to investigate different variables that contribute to a country's happiness score and to compare these scores across countries. The data set we chose (happiness-data) already included information about the extent to which certain variables explain a country's happiness score.
    We used five different methods to visualize our data: stacked barplot, scatterplot, heatmap, choropleth map, and regression. Our stacked barplot and scatterplot visualized how much a given factor such as social support or life expectancy impacted a country's hapiness score. These graphics also provide a means of comparing how much different factors impact different countries. The heatmap we created focuses on one factor, trust. This was a measure of how much people believed others could be trusted in their country. Given the large impact of residual factors and our prior knowledge about trust, we decided to see how this factor might contribute to happiness scores. We visualized how this measure changed over time in each country. With our regressions, we looked at the relationship between trust and other variables including: happiness, social support, and corruption.
    Unlike our other graphics, the choropleth map does not visualize factors that contribute to happiness, but rather visualized happiness itself. This graphic visualizes happiness data on a world map and serve to highlight potential geographic patterns.

Dataset
    We chose to use the happiness-data that was already uploaded onto Jupyter. This dataset originally came from the World Happiness Report. https://worldhappiness.report/
    
Running the Code
    The code should be run by running the code from top to bottom. The code could be changed to run similar analyses on different data sets. 
    
Contributing
    This project could be furhtered by visualizing the changes in more than one variable over time. Additionally, the choropleth map could be changed to incorporate some of these explanatory variables into the map.
