# Overview

This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences.  Specifically:
- We were interested after looking at the story shown in the movie moneyball to see how data has played a role in golf. As we found, a particular metric (strokes gained) showed that driving distance and driving accuracy we're the best predictors for players success. We sought to see how these metrics did in fact predict success which we defined as tournament money won by players

# Running the code

The code for our project can be found in the following [notebook](https://github.com/scottstuart11/strokes-gained/blob/master/strokes_gained.ipynb)

# Contributing to the code

Tell other people how they can contribute to the project you've started.  Specifically:
- people can contribute by looking at other metrics and how they correlate with tournament money won
# Acknowledgements

We found help with graphs on stack overflow whose links can be found in the notebook as well as help from api's for manipulating / transposing our data set
