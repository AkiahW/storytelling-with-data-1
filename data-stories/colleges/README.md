# Final Project

## Overview

As a college student about to graduate with debt, I'm curious about how the finances of attending college interact with other demographics about students and the institutiom itself. I looked at datasets on general facts about higher education institutions in the US, their cost of attendance, the graduation rates of their students, and how much money those students receive in grants and loans. 

## Downloading the dataset

I downloaded these four college datasets from tuitiontracker.org. 


## Running the code

This notebook should be run in order and careful attention should be paid to which combined dataframes are used for each plot. The dataset(s) must be in the same folder as the notebook.

## Contributing to the code

Others can contribute to this project by creating more plots along other dimensions, potentially realizing new trends. Additionally, the dataframes contain more information on graduation rates beyond the standard 4 years which may reveal more trends that haven't yet been explored in this project.
