# Project information

Sentiment analysis of Twitter reactions after instances of Domestic Violnece on HBO's Euphoria. The team consists of Akiah Watts (AkiahW) and Saruul (Saruulijile2).

# Overview

This project is an analysis of two characters in the HBO show Euphoria. Since there is a consistent air time of the show, we were able to collect Twitter reactions directly after the episode aired but before the next episode. We specifically looked at reactions after episodes where each character engaged in violence toward their girlfriend.

What we were specifically interested in was whether there would be potentially racially driven differences between public opinion of the characters since one is a caucasian male and the other is a Black male or if there would be a halo effect and more forgiveness for his actions since Nate's character is ridiculously attractive. To explore the public perception, we manually scraped Twitter data on each of the characters of interest (Nate and McKay) in the time frame of the date the episode aired to the day before the next episode (a week). We used bar graphs and word clouds to visualize the data. Since the event of abuse wasn't isolated in the episode (Nate also threatened another character (Jules) in the episode where he physically abused his girlfriend and McKay experienced a traumatic hazing event directly before he was rough with his girlfriend) these events also colored the perception of the action. Interestingly, in McKay's case, people were generally more concerned about his mental state after his traumatic event than angry at him for how he physically took his emotions out on his girlfriend. Whereas people's tweets generally tended to have negative valence while insulting Nate and wanting to see justice served either through pressing charges or by his victims teaming up against him.

This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences.  Specifically:
- What was your main question?
- How did you approach exploring and/or answering your question?
  - What data did you use?
  - What sorts of data science tools did you use?
- What did you find or accomplish (be brief)?  For example, did you find any interesting results or insights?  Or did you solve an interesting problem that might be useful in another project?

Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).  (Sample slides [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/modules_and_numpy.md) and [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/pandas.md).)

# Downloading the data

Provide a link to the dataset(s) you're using for the project, along with a brief description of the data.

# Running the code

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.  If the project is implemented in one or more Colaboratory notebooks, you should provide a link to the notebook(s) here.  Also copy the notebooks (as .ipynb files) into your project folder so that everything related to your project is backed up on GitHub.

# Contributing to the code

Tell other people how they can contribute to the project you've started.  Specifically:
- What are the most obvious next steps?
- What are some questions that your work raises?
- What challenges remain?
- Are there any known bugs or problems with your approach that someone continuing your project should be aware of?

# Acknowledgements

If your idea is based on or inspired by someone else's work (either their code or their ideas), cite them and provide links to their work.  Also, if you received help or support from someone who is not listed as an author on this project, you should acknowledge them here.
