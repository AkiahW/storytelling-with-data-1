College Sports & Admissions Story

Laya Indukuri (i-laya)

# Overview

My my question was to find out if student-athletes have a different admissions process, and if so, whether or not it is "fair". I was inspired to explore this by the recent Operation Varsity Blues scandal. I found many news articles and sources with interesting data that I put into Google Sheets and played around with in Colab so that the tables would work with the visualizations I wanted to show.


Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).  (Sample slides [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/modules_and_numpy.md) and [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/pandas.md).)

# Contributing to the code

Challenges:

It was challenging to find data on the socioeconomic status of the student-athletes, which I think would be a good future direction to consider.

Interpretations and conclusions:

I found that athletics related college admissions do have a higher rate of admission, but this primarily benefits wealthy white individuals. Further exploration can uncover the exact changes in admission rates and potential ways to benefit all qualified student-athletes equally, regardless of their SES.

Future directions:

A starting point for future directions could be identifying which colleges in particular are more "unfair" than others in order to understand why that is and how we can fix it.

I was largely inspired by the Operation Varsity Blues scandal of 2019.
