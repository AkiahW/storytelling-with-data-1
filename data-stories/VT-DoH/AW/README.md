# Project information
The correlation between fast food restuarants, access to healthcare, income, and coronary heart disease/stroke levels in per county in Vermont. Authors include Alex Wells and Akiah Watts (AkiahW). Alex Wells found the heart disease and income data sets, and worked on the coding/debugging. Akiah Watts made the fast food per county file, helped with the coding/debugging, and edited the video. 

# Overview
Our main question is to see whether there is an intereaction between the amount of fast food restuarants in a county, heart attack/stroke leveles, and income. Mainly, we wanted to see if locations with more fast food restuarnts and lower income had higher prevalences of heart attacks/strokes than places with fewer fast food restuarants and high income levels. 

We approached this question by aggregating the number of popular fast food chains per county in Vermont and then mapping the amount of fast food chains per capita.

Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).

# Downloading the data

Food file shows the number of various fast food resturants per county in Vermont. This data set was created by our team using the listed sources 
Food file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/master/data-stories/VT-DoH/Fast%20Food%20Restaurants%20-%20Sheet1.csv
Sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djIMtBM74CTyHmichuHmLFcyj79AcU0ERvr2m4WuCQI/edit?usp=sharing

Income file shows the income tax returns pre county in Vermont.
Income: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexwells-22/storytelling-with-data/master/data-stories/VT-DoH/vt_income_stats_2020_county%20-%20CtyInc.csv

Access file indicates the percentage of people between the ages of 18-64 by county from 2008-2015 with access to health services and compares it to the percentage of people in the state with access to health services.

Heart file shows the coronary heart disease death rate per 100,000 people by counties in Vermont from 2000-2015 and then compares it to the entire state of Vermont.

# Running the code

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.  If the project is implemented in one or more Colaboratory notebooks, you should provide a link to the notebook(s) here.  Also copy the notebooks (as .ipynb files) into your project folder so that everything related to your project is backed up on GitHub.
