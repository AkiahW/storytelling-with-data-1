## Overview
    
    The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the audio features of top spotify songs. The dataset I chose from Kaggle included the top 100 Spotify songs from 2018. 
    To visualize the data, I used scatterplot, a heatmap and a barplot,

    To run the code start from the top, and make sure that the spotify dataset is uploaded in the same folder. 
    
## Contributing
    This project could be furhtered by visualizing the changes in more than one variable over time. Additionally, the choropleth map could be changed to incorporate some of these explanatory variables into the map.
