# Storytelling with Data Assignment 4: Tell your first (notebook-based) data story!

Note: please work through the material in [Module 4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md#module-4-data-science-tools) before beginning this assignment.

For this assignment, you'll be telling a story that seeks to answer or explore
questions related to the [Coronavirus
(COVID-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).  You can
choose any question and/or dataset(s) to analyze for this assignment.

Your story should be analogous to the ones you put together in [Assignment
1](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/assignments/assignment%201/Assignment_1.md)
and [Assignment
2](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/assignments/assignment%202/Assignment_2.md),
but it must be data-driven (like the story you told for Assignment 2).  You
should support your narrative with specific statistics, data visualizations,
and/or other figures that you generate in your notebook.

You may work on this assignment individually, or in groups of any size you
choose.

# Story format

You should use this [demo
project](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/tree/master/data-stories/demo)
and as a template for putting your story together.  The sample notebook contains
a recommended approach to organizing your notebook (although you may stray from
that recommended format if you feel it's necessary).  Your project should
comprise:
- A single Google Colaboratory-compatible notebook containing your (or your group's) story and code.  Name the notebook `groupname.ipynb`, where `groupname` is replaced with a unique identifier for your group (e.g., your last name and first initial, a made-up team name, etc.).
- A README file formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).  Name the file `groupname.md` (again replacing `groupname` with the same unique identifier that you used to name your notebook).
- A YouTube video (linked to in your README file) of your story.  The precise format of your recorded story is up to you, but I suggest that you either do a narrated screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or a narrated screencast of a slideshow with figures pasted in from your notebook.
