# Overview

This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences.  Specifically:
- What was your main question?
- How did you approach exploring and/or answering your question?
  - What data did you use?
  - What sorts of data science tools did you use?
- What did you find or accomplish (be brief)?  For example, did you find any interesting results or insights?  Or did you solve an interesting problem that might be useful in another project?

Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).  (Sample slides [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/modules_and_numpy.md) and [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/pandas.md).)

### We couldn't investigate every factor that could explain why certain states were impacted more financially than others.
- Find more datasets of possible factors to potentially explain why some states were impacted more.
- Examine the differences in how small vs. large businesses were affected.
- What type of businesses were impacted more than others?
- What are more factors that could affect Vermont that we did not consider?
