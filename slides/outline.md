- Read [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xhpjth2f4aamn5u/layered-grammar.pdf) by Hadley Wickham
- Discussion: telling effective stories about data
   - Which elements of "traditional" storytelling apply to data stories?
   - What are the most compelling (convincing, interesting, etc.) data stories that you've encountered?
     - What made them compelling?  Were there common themes or principles?
- Assignment 2: present a 5-minute constructive critique of any data story from [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/):
  - Summarize the key ideas and how they're conveyed
  - Say what was effective and what wasn't (and *why*!)  
  - Think of a better way that some part of the "story" could have been presented.  Sketch out a new figure or representation.

## Module 3: Python and Jupyter notebooks as a medium for data storytelling
- Discussion: what's a programming language and why might computers be a useful tool for data storytelling?
  - What actions or instructions might you need to convey to a computer in order to tell it what to do?
  - When do (or don't) we need computers to help us tell our data stories?
  - What are some strengths and weaknesses you think a computer-based approach to data storytelling might have?
- Getting set up on Google Colaboratory

- Discussion:
  - Brainstorm different visualization ideas using some of the tools we've learned about
  - What sorts of insights into our data could we gain from the tools we've learned about?
  - Are there limitations of these tools that might hold us back?  How might we overcome those limitations?
  - How might you organize your code in a notebook to tell an effective data story?
- Assignment 4: tell your first (notebook-based) data story!
